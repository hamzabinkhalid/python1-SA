# variable declaration
# in python there is no keyword for declaring a variable, except sometimes,
# like global, nonlocal
# this means variable must be initialized with a value when first declared

my_var = 1

my_name = "Hamza"

print(type(my_var))
print(type(my_name))

#  Getting input from user
your_name = input("Enter your name: ")

print(your_name)
