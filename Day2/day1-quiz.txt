1. List some of the characteristics of Python.
- It is interperated language
- It follows snake_case
- It is dynamically typed (t doesn't require for you to write type of variable before declaring or initializing it)
- It is object oriented language
- Easy to learn (its syntax is declerative rather than imperative like Java
 
2. The Python interpreter can be executed in two ways. What are they?
- REPL/Interactive
- Script mode

- A variable is a reference in the memory to hold some data

x = 12

9. What value does the number 1 become when passed to a float() wrapper function?
- 1.0
 
11. What value does the string value "Hello" become when passed to a bool() wrapper function?
